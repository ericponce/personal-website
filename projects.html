                        For MIT's <a href="https://web.mit.edu/evt/index.html">Electric Vehicle Team</a> Opel GT Project, we required a battery management system (BMS) for a custom battery pack. 
                        We found that BMS companies at the time were not willing to work with us, so we set out to build our <a href="https://github.com/ericponce/ltc-battery-management-system">own</a>, with the added benefit as serving as an educational exercise.
                        I led the team to develop bare-metal firmware for an NXP LPC11Cx4 microcontroller that interfaced with battery management hardware centered around a LTC6804 12-cell integrated circuit.
                        To support these efforts, I developed a bare-metal build system, code examples, unit testing infrastructure, and the overall system architecture.
                        The main goal was safety for our Opel GT project, but the project eventually found successful use by MIT's <a href="https://www.mitsolar.com/">Solar Electric Vehicle Team</a> and MIT's <a href="https://fsae.mit.edu/">Formula SAE Team</a>.

                        Here, we focused on modularity, so that we may reuse the work in future projects and to allow for development by younger team members, and safety.
                        All of the modules communicated via CAN bus and were centered around LPC11Cx4 microcontrollers, for which I had done most of the firmware developing heavy lifting.

                        To support architectural design decisions, I, along with other members of MIT's <a href="https://web.mit.edu/evt/index.html">Electric Vehicle Team</a>, developed <a href="https://github.com/ericponce/can_validator">scripts</a> for validating a CAN bus specification.
                        These scripts could take in a a textfile description of the various CAN bus messages that would move throughout a system and check that messages don't have repeated symbolic names or conflicting IDs.
                        They would also check that defined data fields did not overlap and fit within the CAN frame data field, among a few other sanitary verifications.

                        MIT's <a href="https://web.mit.edu/evt/index.html">Electric Vehicle Team</a> was donated a palette of A123 Prismatic LiIon Battery Modules with built in BMS but with very little in the way of documentation.
                        We also didn't have a safe way to charge these batteries.
                        So, I developed <a href="https://github.com/ericponce/a123-battery-integration">hardware and firmware</a> for reading and controlling the integrated BMS boards, and for coordinating charging efforts with contactors (for safety) and a Brusa DC Charger over CAN.
                        The focus for this project was safety and reliability, so that no one had to `babysit` the modules, and accurate cell balancing to prevent damage to the modules.

                        For my 6.115 Microcomputer Lab final project I developed an implementation of Conway's game of life on a PSoC connected to a display over VGA. 
                        This implementation had several features, including bluetooth/WiFi control, saving/loading state to/from an SD Card, and colorized tracking of cell lifetime.
                        VGA was implemented entirely on the PSoC, leveraging DMA and it's extremely configurable hardware.

                        To support MIT <a href="https://web.mit.edu/evt/index.html">Electric Vehicle Team's</a> NY Electric Trike Project, I developed a custom electronic brake system for slowing our extremely heavy battery pack.
                        We needed a way of actuating a pair of rim brakes on the bike trailer, and while a mechanical linkage was preferred initially, mocking up the requirements for quick disconnects and cable pull routing lead us to shift to electrical actuation. 
                        The system used a worm-driven motor to pull and release the brake cable; because this can not be back driven (a property of the work gear) the motor does not need to stall to continue apply brake force. 
                        While the ME's worked on enclosures and mounting, we produced a schematic and a board layout for this task using an Attiny85 micro-controller at the center.
                        I also developed firmware to support the control in a reliable and safe manner.

                        In the process of developing firmware for MIT's <a href="https://web.mit.edu/evt/index.html">Electric Vehicle Team</a>, I found the need for bit-banged serial output interface.
                        We had run out of hardware serial blocks, and it seemed like a fun challenge, so I wrote my <a href="https://github.com/ericponce/Bit-Bang-Debug">own</a>.
