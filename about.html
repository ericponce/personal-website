                I received my BS from MIT in Electrical Engineering in 2017.
                During my time as an undergraduate, I spent most of my time outside of class either with the MIT Electric Vehicle Team or working on research projects through MIT's undergraduate research opportunity program (UROP).
                On the Electric Vehicle Team, I led my fellow members to develop a custom battery management system (BMS) for our electric Opel GT project.
                At the time, we were having trouble sourcing an off the shelf BMS and we wanted to explore state-of-charge and state-of-health algorithms, so we set out to design and build our own.
                Eventually, this BMS would see use in other teams' projects, like FSAE's formula E vehicle, and Solar EVT's vehicle.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I also received my MEng in 2019 and my PhD in 2023 from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, for which I was a NACME UCEM Scholar and during which I worked in the Electromechanical Systems Group under Professor Steven Leeb.
                During this time, I focused on developing systems for nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), a powerful technology that leverages intelligent sensing and signal processing to 
                disaggregate signals to extract the operation of individual loads in a system.
                My first focus was on noninvasively retrofitting water and natural gas meters to convert them from simple totalizing meters for billing purposes
                into high quality flow rate meters that may generate data for NILM and other diagnostic purposes.
                My goal with this project was to design a system that is both minimally invasive and cheap to construct.
                Later, I looked at novel ways to power sensors by harvesting the magnetic field produced by current carrying conductors that are found throughout our world.
                Finally, I developed methods used in analyzing the stability of loads connected to a grid through rectifiers.

            <p class="text">
                Early on, I TA'd for the microcontroller and power electronics lab classes: 6.115 and 6.131.
                For the remainder of my time in graduate school, I continued to serve in an advisory role by mentoring the new TAs and filling in where I could.
                For my work in these classes, in particular that done to make the classes compatible with remote learning at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I won the 2022 Grainger Foundation Teaching Award.
                I also mentored tens of undergraduate and graduate researches on research group projects and the development of electronics classes.
                Two classes were developed during my time as a researcher in the group, both of which aimed to be hands on introductions to electronic design principles: Practical Magic and Electronics FIRST.
                For the former, I won the 2017 Practical Magic Teaching Award (an award for "Practical Magic" from MIT is one of my proudest accomplishments).
                For the latter, I had the fortune of teaching an abridged version of the class to gifted high school students from around the Caribbean at the 2023 SPISE Program run by the Caribbean Science Foundation.

            <p class="text">
                Throughout my time in school I also had the fortune of working for world class companies as an electrical engineer intern.
                My first internship at Apple had me working in the iPad Systems Group where incredible technology from the various component groups 
                was brought together to create a unified and robust iPad that "just works."
                There, I was able to work with a vendor to improve the operation of the USB power delivery circuitry, which was still a nascent technology at the time. 
                I was also given the opportunity to provide engineering support on a large-scale prototype run in Shenzhen, China, which was absolutely eye opening.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Later, I was recruited by the venerable T. J. Rodgers, founder of many incredible companies, to assist in the redesign of 
                an exciting automated watering system for agriculture at WaterBit Inc. 
                This wireless system designed for extremely harsh environments used no batteries and operated entirely off of sunlight to track soil moisture and keep crops
                at their optimal water level.
                Grapes, for example, produce the most complex flavors when pushed to the edge of dehydration, which requires very careful water management.
                There, I also developed novel ways to detect failed valve actuations to prevent devastating losses.
